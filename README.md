E-tickets comercialization platform

---
Overview: An application for management, comercialization and exchanging of tickets for one event or multiple events. The purchase of a ticket implies creating an account on the platform and giving some id information (to avoid buying tickets in bulk). Tickets purchased are available in electronic format on the user's account. There is also the administrator role(event organizer) who can modify the number of tickets, the price and maybe ticket type (general access, vip, etc). The regular users who cannot attend the event anymore have the option to sell the ticket in the same app, on a ticket exchanging section. There, people can list their tickets and their prices and interact with buyers, who have the option of getting 'second-hand' tickets.

**Main functionalities**:
* *Storing user accounts and passwords.*
